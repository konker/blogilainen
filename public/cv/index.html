                <h4>Tekninen Asiantuntija (Technology Specialist)</h4>
                <p>
                HIIT is a joint research institution of Aalto University and the University of Helsinki, two of Finland's leading universities.
                My role here was to draw on real-world experience and lend practical implementation support to a variety of projects based in the <a href="http://hiit.fi/fi">Future Internet</a> and <a href="http://hiit.fi/ns">Network Society</a> research programmes.
                </p>
                <p>
                Highlights include: working on a peer-to-peer social network called <a href="http://www.peerscape.org/">Peerscape</a>; collaborating on <a href="http://www.browsersocket.org">BrowserSocket</a>, a proof-of-concept socket listener exposed to javascript in a browser; running a code-camp at the University of Helsinki; running a code-camp at the University of Nairobi as part of the diversification of the <a href="http://sizl.org/">OtaSizzle</a> living-lab project; and helping to create an iphone-based interface to a home energy-sensing network for the <a href="http://www.energyawareness.eu/beaware/">BeAware</a> project which was a consortium made up of members from Finland, Sweden and Italy.
                </p>
                <p>
                This work was set in an atmosphere of experimentation and learning, so I had the freedom to persue interesting angles or technologies as projects required them, and to collaborate with a diverse range of people and fields. Also the involvement with the teaching side of the institute's activities was a rewarding change from my usual work.

                <h4>Senior Developer</h4>
                <p>
                This Bristol based digital agency took on a number of people to seed its expansion into London. I was taken on to lead the technical side of the London office. As this was started as a small venture which would grow itself I was placed in a position where I had to cover both front-end and back-end technical work as well as being involved in the technical aspects of pitches and working with designers and producers advising in a technical capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                During this time front-end work was rigorously focused on accessibility, standards and best practices, whilst also unobtrusively providing modern and interactive interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                A large client that we worked with was the BBC. The work was based on DNA, the BBC's in-house user generated content platform. I was tasked with going in and learning the system whilst providing maintenance. As a result of my work we were commissioned for further high-profile jobs involving the DNA platform. I was in effect seconded to the BBC to provide the technical resource during the build of these projects.  I worked in various departments of the BBC and was involved in technical work, pitches for further work, liaising with clients as to the direction their sites would take, and working with our internal account managers on developing the BBC account.

                Butterfly Effect was started as an offshoot of Dimension Data to develop a more design led brand which would enable the servicing of smaller non-corporate clients and to do more specialist and innovative work.

                I was part of a small team which founded an internet venture backed by private funding. I was in charge of the design and development of the web site as well as assisting in the business side of the operation from a technical perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                takeU2.com was, at the time, an innovative idea which provided venue listings and reviews and allowed events and meetings to be organized around these venues. The main interface was a scrollable London Underground map which we obtained an exclusive license to use in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                Due to the startup nature of the venture, we had free reign to design and build the site in any way we saw fit. We chose principally open source technologies and were early adopters of JSP 1.0 backed by a Java object model and a Sybase RDBMS. Bespoke content management and moderation systems were built in addition to the public facing site. My role was by necessity multi-facetted and included system architecture, JSP, Java, JDBC, SQL, Sybase admin, HTML/DHTML, Unix admin, Shell scripting, Usability testing, and customer relations.
