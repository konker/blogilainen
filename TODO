- output format should be passed to the stylesheet as parameter
    - possibly with "link"?
    - could then use xslt modes for outputting different formats?

- resources metadata
    - name of this?
    - at the moment is being inserted into the src xml document
        - should find alternative
            - could write to an xml file
                - can xsl import an xml file into a document?
            - can we pass a document fragment as a param?
                - maybe need extension of some kind?

        - should also think about writing/debugging xslt
            - pos. without dynamic generation of resource metadata
- plugin architecture?
    - i.e. dynamiclally load all modules in a certain package
        - e.g. for meta generation
            - adding extra meta elements
