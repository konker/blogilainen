- is the whole idea flawed?
    - revert to wiki or markdown?
        - use existing system such as jekyll, etc?
    - extend markdown (or similar?)
        - sections
        - class
        - id


- what could we do to drastically simplify?
    - assume html output, in one place
    - assume can hardcode links as normal <a href="..">..</a>
    - keep xml
    - keep xslt
    - keep all-resources-meta.xml?


- what about 2-stage process: (markdown) -> xml -> output?
    - any md files found are first converted to resource xml format
    - continue as usual
    - allows md for most things with specific xml for e.g. CV
    - is this over-egging the pudding?

- do we want to have multiple runs rather than multiple outputs
  from the same run?
    - could then specify alternative output directories?
        - where would this be specified
            - (must work as post-commit hook..)
            - some kind of config file?
                - XML?
                - config format?

- could we have some kind of (optional) indexing stage?
    - what for if it is a static site?

- output format should be passed to the stylesheet as parameter
    - could then use xslt modes for outputting different formats?

- at the moment we have support for alternative extensions/versions of files 
  in the same target path
    - is this at all useful?
        - most likely not
        - SCRAP?

    - what about the same extension in alternative paths?
        - e.g. /public/html/index.html
               /public/mobile/index.html

        - path prefix?
        - path descriptor, "/mobile/%r/%f.%e"
            - substitute %x for some variable value?

- Does this only work with absolute/root-relative links?
    - or would you need to resolve the link at run time for each output?
        - sounds too messy...

- <a resource="__id__">..</a>

- resources metadata
    - name of this?
    - at the moment is being inserted into the src xml document
        - should find alternative
            - could write to an xml file
                - can xsl import an xml file into a document?
            - can we pass a document fragment as a param?
                - maybe need extension of some kind?

        - should also think about writing/debugging xslt
            - pos. without dynamic generation of resource metadata
- plugin architecture?
    - i.e. dynamiclally load all modules in a certain package
        - e.g. for meta generation
            - adding extra meta elements
